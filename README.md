# microservices-analysis

Microservice analysis- This project analysis will help us to understand , how properly we can create spring boot micro services and 
how efficiantly we deploy on kubernetes, 
we will try to explore below some of things :  
1. Docker container
2. Kubernetes
3. Lagoon.  -  tool which helps for deployment https://lagoon.sh/
4. Kubesphere  - https://kubesphere.io/
5. Monitoring of application. - 
6. Creating serviceMesh - https://medium.com/cloudzone/k8s-service-mesh-linkerd-or-istio-4bb650d51bc6
7. Springboot Applications / creating cluster of multiple microservice

### Things we will try to cover 
1. Create Spring boot application
2. Create DockerFile
3. Create Docker Image from DOckerFile with tag
4. Run DockerImage on docker first
5. Create kubectl config file and all basic configuration
6. Create and deploy config file on kubectl -  Understand Kubectl Deployments, service, pods, logs and config
